Thank you to the Grammy voters for the incredible honor. Thank you to everyone who worked so hard to beautifully capture the profundity of deep southern culture. I thank god for my family, my wonderful husband, my beautiful daughter my fans for bringing me so much happiness and support. We all experience pain and loss, and often we become inaudible. My intention for the film and album was to create a body of work that would give a voice to our pain, our struggles, our darkness and our history. To confront issues that make us uncomfortable. It's important to show images to my children to reflect their beauty, so they can grow up in a world where they look in the mirror, first at their own families, as well as the news, the Super Bowl, the Olympics, the white house and the Grammy's and see themselves and have no doubt that they're beautiful, intelligent and capable. This is something I want for every child of every race, and I feel its vital that we learn from the past and recognize our tendencies to repeat our mistakes. Thank you again for honoring Lemonade. Have a beautiful evening. Thank you for tonight, this is incredible", "image": "https://images.genius.com/06364218f8f65d12c9f05b51d08228f5.1000x1000x1.jpg"}], "artist": "Beyonc\u00e9"}
